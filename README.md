# Express JS - Apollo GraphQL - Mongoose Boilerplate

This is a bare bones boiler plate to get a Graph server running and hooking it up to a MongoDB cluster.

To connecto to the MongoDB you'll need the following in a **`.env`** file:

```
MONGODB_USERNAME=
MONGODB_PASS=
MONGODB_URI=
```

Clone the provided `.env.dist` and fill in the environment variables with the needed credentials for your MongoDB Cluster.
